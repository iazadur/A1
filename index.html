                    <h3>Shrimp Tempura</h3>
                    <p>Tempura, or batter frying, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 16th century. This style
                        of cooking was brought to the island of Japan by the Portuguese and quickly became an integral
                        part of a chef’s repertoire. Now, on most Japanese menus around the world you can find tempura
                        options like vegetable, shrimp, fish, seafood, and even lobster. When we had the opportunity to
                        take a cooking class in Kyoto, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to learn how to cook it
                        ourselves! </p>

                    <h3>Cold Meat Is the Ultimate Summer Party Entrée</h3>
                    <p>There are few things better than a summer dinner party and few things worse than cooking for one.
                        Sweating over a red-hot grill in August heat as your guests get steadily drunker and hungrier
                        makes for a truly unpleasant hosting experience.Make-ahead dishes are the savior of any host or
                        hostess trying to do the mostest, and as I recently learned from this piece in Bon Appétit, cold
                        meat is the ultimate focal point of a made-ahead feast.</p>

                    <h3>Butternut Squash Chilli And Coconut Soup</h3>
                    <p>This soup would also make an excellent dinner party starter, as it can be made ahead of time and
                        reheated. It’s particularly good if you have invited people with different dietary requirements
                        as it is vegetarian, vegan, gluten free and dairy free. The soup looks very pretty decorated
                        with fresh red chillies, pumpkin seeds and coriander leaves. But if that is too much fuss, just
                        leave the decoration off, it will still taste delicious without the decoration!</p>
